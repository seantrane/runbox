## About <a id="about"></a>

The **Docker RunBox** is a portable shell environment and toolkit for software/ops engineers, using Docker.

The primary benefits are:

- Encapsulate many _typical_ dependencies that software/ops engineers use on a regular basis.
- Expedite onboarding and reduce dependency demands on the host machine.
- Provide engineers with a shared environment for all command line operations.
- Provide engineers with a shared library of automation and shell scripts.

There are 3 default _RunBoxes_ that can be built and launched independently:

- BaseBox (`basebox`) = _Enhanced shell environment using Bash v4._
- DevBox (`devbox`) = _Enhanced shell + full suite of polyglot developer dependencies and IaC utilities._
- OpsBox (`opsbox`) = _Enhanced shell + Ops-related and Infrastructure-as-Code utilities._

The solution allows for many _RunBoxes_ to be created, as each _RunBox_ is an individual `Dockerfile`.

It is meant to be forked and manicured to whatever liking an individual wishes, as everyone has their own unique preferences.

## Install <a id="install"></a>

### 1. Clone repo

Clone repo in a directory you feel comfortable with.
_These instructions use the `$HOME` directory/variable._

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seantrane/runbox.git "$HOME/runbox"
```

### 2. Run installer

Creates aliases in host machine's `.profile` file that resolve to the _RunBox_ binaries.

```sh
"$HOME/runbox/scripts/install"
```

### 3. Restart your shell environment

---

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

If the Docker image has not been built, then it will automatically be built.

For these docs, `basebox` is the _RunBox_ used, but the behaviors are identical for all _RunBoxes_.

### Run any binary (from the _RunBox_) in your current directory

This command will launch the `basebox` container, run the binary-command, then terminate the container.

```sh
basebox bash --version
```

### Launch the _RunBox_ container

This will mount the current directory on the host machine to the `/mnt/pwd` directory in the RunBox Docker image.

This means the Docker container will have access to the host file system, from the directory you choose to launch it from.

```sh
basebox
```

### Shell environment enhancements are enabled via `dotfiles`

Shell environment enhancements, such as aliases, can be found/configured in the [`src/dotfiles`](src/dotfiles) directory.

Every file in the `dotfiles` directory named `*.symlink` are symlinked to `$HOME/.*` files in the _RunBoxes_.
For example, `bash_profile.symlink` is symlinked to `$HOME/.bash_profile` in the _RunBox_.

### The _RunBox_ has many built-in aliases, functions and shortcuts

Aliases and functions can only be accessed while inside the container, because the `exec` command doesn't know they exist.

> If you enter `la` command, after launching the container, you should see a list of directory contents from the host machine.

Note: Some aliases/functions may only work on _RunBoxes_ that contain their respective dependencies.
For example; `npm` aliases will only work on a _RunBox_ containing `npm`.

### Alias & Function Reference

#### File system shortcuts

```sh
la       # =>  ls -lahF --color --time-style=long-iso
..       # =>  cd ..
...      # =>  cd ../..
....     # =>  cd ../../..
```

#### Git

```sh
gac      # =>  git add -A && git commit -m
glog     # =>  List all Git commits
```

#### Node.js/npm

```sh
npmlistg # =>  List all global npm packages
npmlist  # =>  List all local npm packages
```

#### AWS

```sh
awslist      # =>  List AWS Named Profiles (aws-adfs list).
awslogin     # =>  Scripted aws-adfs login routine.
awslogout    # =>  Scripted aws-adfs reset routine.
```
